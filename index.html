			<p>My name is Victoria and I grew up in Orlando, FL. When I first discovered I could leave this city on my own, I was itching to explore. Traveling has become one of my passions and I try to do it as much as I can. I ended up moving to Los Angeles after seeking a new place I could call home. 
			</p>
		
			<p> About a month ago, I decided to leave my second home and come back to Orlando to attempt to save money and pick up a new skill. So far, I think this is a pretty good decision.</p>
